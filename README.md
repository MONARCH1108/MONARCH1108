# 💫 About Me:
I’m E.Y.S.V.S Abhay, a fourth-year Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. I build practical, end-to-end intelligent systems using Python and modern AI tools, with a focus on solving real-world problems through automation, data analysis, and model-driven workflows. My work spans autonomous agents, RAG pipelines, semantic search engines, AI-powered assistants, and data-centric applications.

My projects explore the intersection of deep learning, LLMs, and software engineering — including AI assistants, autonomous data analysis agents, customizable code reviewers, and intelligent system integrations. I prefer modular, scalable code that is clean, well-structured, and production-ready.

In addition to AI systems, I also build full-stack and web applications, continually learning new technologies and strengthening my skills in Flask, Streamlit, LangChain, vector databases, and web frameworks. I enjoy research, experimentation, and translating ideas into working applications that can be used and extended further.
